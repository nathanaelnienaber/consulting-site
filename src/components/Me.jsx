        <h2>Hi, I'm Nathanael</h2>
        <p>
          My goal is to help 100 companies modernize their systems and processes by 2035
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve worn a lot of hats—Tech Startup Founder & CEO, Technical Product Manager, and C-Suite Chief of Staff. Along the way, I’ve helped companies run large-scale modernization efforts and lead teams through real change.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m deeply passionate about my faith and my family. I love Thai food, business books, road trips, and coffee dates with my wife. I’m also endlessly fascinated by how companies are built—and how they grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s what I’ve learned: older companies don’t need to spend millions on consultants to update outdated systems. With the right approach, it’s totally possible to modernize without the massive price tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve lived this firsthand—helping manage multi-million dollar consulting projects to transform decades-old technology. Now, I’m focused on helping more businesses do the same, faster and more affordably.
