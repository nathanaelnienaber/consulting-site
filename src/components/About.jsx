        <h2>You’ve Built a Business That Lasts. Now Let’s Make It Easy to Run.</h2>
        <p>Your business has stood the test of time — but behind the scenes, things might feel clunky:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Manual processes</li>
            <li>Overlapping tools</li>
            <li>Teams working around systems instead of with them</li>
            <li>Your tech clutter worrys you</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>You’re not looking to “blow it all up.” You just want things to work better.
That’s where I come in.</p>
